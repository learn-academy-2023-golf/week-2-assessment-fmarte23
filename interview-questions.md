# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: FEM

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameter is what represents an argument. And I think argument is the value inside the parentheses in an anonymous function.

Researched answer: Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration. Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. 

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: Objects deal with the collection of data while classes are the templates of objects.

Researched answer: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior. Classes are the blueprint or templates for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: this is the process of doing an action multiple times to obtain a certain result. An example I remember in class is a for loop. 

Researched answer: In development, iteration is the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met. Many computer programs and programming languages use iterations to perform specific tasks, solve problems, and present solutions.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: 
The spread operator is commonly used to make deep copies of JS objects. When we have nested arrays or nested data in an object, the spread operator makes a deep copy of top-level data and a shallow copy of the nested data. Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.

2. React:
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js

3. JSX: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
